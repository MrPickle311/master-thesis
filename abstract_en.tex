\noindent\textbf{Title:} Real-Time Data Analysis from Multi-Sensor Systems Using Kubernetes Cluster and Big Data Tools\\

This master's thesis presents the design, implementation, and performance analysis of a real-time data processing system for multi-sensor environments, utilizing a microservice architecture based on Kubernetes cluster and Big Data tools, particularly Apache Kafka and Kafka Streams.

The thesis focuses on efficiently acquiring, processing, and analyzing data streams generated by multi-sensor systems in industrial environments, with particular emphasis on production processes such as ammonia synthesis (Haber process). The proposed system enables real-time monitoring of industrial installations, anomaly detection, and prediction of potential failures.

The experimental research demonstrates that using a Kubernetes cluster as a platform for deploying an analytical system provides flexible resource scaling depending on workload, while utilizing stream processing tools such as Apache Kafka enables efficient analysis of large volumes of data in real-time.

The thesis demonstrates practical applications of the developed solution in industry, presenting economic and operational benefits resulting from the implementation of an analytical system based on a Kubernetes cluster and Big Data tools.
