\end{center}

This master's thesis presents the design (chapter \ref{sec:projekt_systemu}), implementation (chapters \ref{sec:implementacja_systemu}, \ref{sec:implementacja_generowania}, \ref{chap:konfiguracja_kubernetes}, \ref{chap:autoryzacja}), and performance and operational analysis (chapters \ref{sec:algorytmy_analizy}) of a real-time data processing system for multi-sensor environments, utilizing a microservice architecture based on a Kubernetes cluster and Big Data tools, including Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.

The thesis focuses on efficiently acquiring, processing, and analyzing data streams generated by multi-sensor systems in industrial environments. The proposed system enables real-time monitoring of industrial installations, anomaly detection, and prediction of potential failures.

The conducted research and analysis demonstrate that using a Kubernetes cluster as a platform for deploying an analytical system provides flexible resource scaling depending on workload. While utilizing stream processing tools such as Apache Spark enables efficient analysis of large volumes of data in real-time.

The thesis also exhibits potential practical applications (chapter \ref{sec:zastosowania_praktyczne}) of the developed solution in industry, presenting economic and operational benefits resulting from the implementation of an analytical system based on a Kubernetes cluster and Big Data tools.
